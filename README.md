# Joey Koch - Portfolio

A custom website to display my capabilities.

## Description

This portfolio website project is part of the Codecademy Fullstack web development course. I am currently about 30% of the way through the course and this is an opportunity to practice the HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript that I have learned.
